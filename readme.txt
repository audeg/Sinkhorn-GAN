Two examples of learning with Sinkhorn divergences :

mke_tf.py : Tensor-flow implementation of learning a generative model for the MNIST dataset
-> code adapted from Jan Mentzen's implementation of a VAE (https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html)

sinkhorn_gan_images.py : pyTorch implementation of learning a generative model for the CIFAR dataset
(uses files sinkhorn.py, utils.py, mmd.py)
-> code adapted from MMD-GAN implementation (https://github.com/OctoberChang/MMD-GAN)
